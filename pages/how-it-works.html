            <p>Paperhook is a cloud based web traffic routing platform.  Put simply, Paperhook can be used to compose a single website from multiple content sources.  When setting up a site in Paperhook, rules will be defined.  These rules are interpreted and used to route traffic appropriately.  This allows for you to provide marketing content to your client's easily without having to go in and manipulate their existing Content Management System.  It also allows you to centralize your marketing content for all of your clients without having to deal with migrations of existing site and various flavors of Content Management System.  Traffic to your website can be routed through Paperhook by completing the simple site setup and modifying the DNS settings for your domain.</p>

            <p>Paperhook also provides advanced caching infrastructure.  Content is cached with appropriate durations based on the type of content and anticipated frequency of change.  This improves performance for existing site content and reduces the load on the website.  Our caching system also protects you from downtime.  If Paperhook recognizes that a site is down, it will continue to serve requests from the resource cache until the site is back online.</p>

            <p>Paperhook can scale according to your need.  As traffic increases for a website, Paperhook's ability to field a larger volume of requests can increase.</p>
